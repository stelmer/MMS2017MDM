Assess the management needs in your environment. One size may not fit all your needs depending on people, their mobility, the devices, and the data they access.
•Consider the requirements. With Windows 10, Configuration Manager and the Enterprise Mobility Suite, you have the flexibility to handle imaging, authentication, settings, and management tools for any scenario.
•Take small steps. Moving towards modern device management doesn’t have to be an overnight transformation.
•Optimize your existing investments. On the road from traditional on-premises management to modern cloud-based management, take advantage of the flexible, hybrid architecture of Configuration Manager and Intune. As additional capabilities become available in the cloud-identity/MDM model, Microsoft is committed to providing a clear path from traditional to modern management.
